\title{Convert Community Structure to Membership Vector}
\usage{
get_membership(CID, Clist)
}
\arguments{
\item{CID}{A numeric vector containing the number of variables in each community.
Each element represents a community, and the value indicates how many variables belong to that community.}

\item{Clist}{A numeric vector containing the indices of variables reordered by community membership.
This vector should contain the original variable indices, arranged sequentially by community.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length equal to \code{Clist}, where each element corresponds to
the community membership (1, 2, 3, etc.) of the variable at that index.
}
\description{
Converts a community structure represented by community sizes and ordered variable indices
into a standard membership vector where each element represents the community assignment
for the corresponding variable.
}
\details{
This function takes two vectors that represent a community structure:
\itemize{
\item \code{CID} contains the sizes of each community
\item \code{Clist} contains the original variable indices, ordered by community
}
The function returns a membership vector that maps each variable to its assigned community,
which is a common format required by many community analysis functions.
}
\examples{
CID <- c(2, 3, 2)  # Community sizes: 2 variables in community 1, 3 in community 2, 2 in community 3
Clist <- c(1, 4, 2, 5, 7, 3, 6)  # Variables ordered by community
membership <- get_membership(CID, Clist)
}
